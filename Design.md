`Building` will be vertices(node) of the graph
    - Nodes stores a reference to each of their vertices
    - Nodes stores a reference to each other edges their are conected with
    These two choices will make the data structures more compact
    We will then be able to evaluate `Paths` spaning the whole graph

`tube` and `teleport` will be edges

# Mind

Measure both graph-distance and geometric-availability, if a node is geometrically available it shall be linked

Maybe Use a grid of 160*90

Geometric space will only ever increase
Paths can evolve (Pods can be modified)


We want Maximal-planar graphs of the largest size possible to have the largest interconectedness (I guess)
